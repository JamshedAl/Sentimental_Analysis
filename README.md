# Sentimental_Analysis
It is a short project, I focused on developing a sentiment analysis model to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral categories. I employed two popular sentiment analysis algorithms, namely TextBlob, to train our model and make accurate predictions.
Our primary objective was to build a robust and efficient sentiment analysis system capable of analyzing text and determining its sentiment. By leveraging the TextBlob algorithms, we explored different approaches to sentiment analysis and compared their performance.
